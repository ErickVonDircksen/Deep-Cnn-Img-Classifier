# Deep-Cnn-Img-Classifier
Deep CNN Image Classifier using Tensorflow and Keras

First build in #-------- tensorflow v2.8.0-----cuda v11.0.194-------cDNN v8.0-------#
This image classifier takes n types (classes) of images. (More classes can be added, I will probably do so in the future)

It is intended to be as easy as possible to adapt to your set of images, just replace your images in the folders "class1" and "class2".... n
the graph shows the accuracy through time, in the loss factor. the graph can be edited to include more variables.
